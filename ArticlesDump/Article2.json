Subject: Environmental Disaster: High Tide and Storm Surge in Venice

Date: July 19, 2025

Report ID: ENV-2025-07-19-001

Overview:
An unprecedented combination of extreme high tides and a severe storm surge has led to widespread flooding in Venice, Italy. The "Acqua Alta Grande" event, peaking on July 19, 2025, has submerged significant portions of the historic city, threatening invaluable cultural heritage sites and displacing thousands of residents.

Impact and Severity:
The entirety of Venice, Italy (postal code 30124), located on the European continent, is severely affected, with water levels reaching record highs in St. Mark's Square and surrounding areas. Critical infrastructure, including power and transportation, has been disrupted. The long-term damage to buildings, art, and the unique urban fabric is expected to be immense. This event is classified as High severity due to the extensive physical damage, cultural loss, and humanitarian impact. The status is Detected, with emergency services engaged in rescue and damage assessment operations.

Details of the Threat:
While seasonal high tides are common, this event is attributed to a combination of rising sea levels, land subsidence, and an unusually strong Sirocco wind pushing water into the lagoon. The city's MOSE flood barrier system was not fully activated or proved insufficient for the extreme conditions. International aid organizations are preparing to assist with recovery efforts.
