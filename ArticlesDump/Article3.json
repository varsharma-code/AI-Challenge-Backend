Overview:

The breach, discovered on July 19, 2025, resulted in unauthorized access to customer names, email addresses, encrypted passwords, and in some cases, partial payment information.

Impact and Severity:

While the company has users globally, the initial compromise vector and most affected user data were routed through this hub. The severity is rated as Medium due to the large volume of compromised personal data, which could lead to phishing attacks and identity theft. The status is Investigating, with the company notifying affected users and cooperating with cybersecurity regulators.

Details of the Threat:
The attackers exploited a misconfigured API endpoint, allowing them to bypass authentication mechanisms and access the user database. The threat is being referred to as "DataVault Exploit." GlobalConnect has taken the vulnerable API offline and is conducting a full forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise and implement enhanced security measures.
