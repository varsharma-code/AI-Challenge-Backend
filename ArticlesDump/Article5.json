Overview:
New Delhi, India, is experiencing a severe air pollution crisis, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) consistently remaining in the "Hazardous" category for the past week. The dense smog has significantly reduced visibility, disrupted daily life, and led to a surge in respiratory illnesses.

Impact and Severity:
The entire National Capital Region of Delhi, India (postal code 110001), situated on the Asian continent, is under a thick blanket of toxic smog. Schools have been closed, outdoor activities curtailed, and hospitals are reporting a dramatic increase in patients with breathing difficulties. The severity is rated as Medium due to the widespread public health impact and disruption to daily life, though not immediately life-threatening for most. The status is Detected, with government agencies implementing emergency measures to curb pollution sources.

Details of the Threat:
The crisis is attributed to a combination of factors including vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, crop stubble burning in neighboring states, and unfavorable meteorological conditions trapping pollutants. The "Smog Veil" threat is a recurring seasonal issue, but its intensity this year is particularly alarming. Authorities are urging residents to stay indoors and use air purifiers.
